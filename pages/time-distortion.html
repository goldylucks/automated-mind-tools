  <h3>Step 0: Set The Stage</h3>
  u know how sometimes u wait in line for half an hour,
  and u look at the time and less than 10 minutes have gone by?
  <br /><br />
  or u r starving waiting for your meal, about to snap at the poor waiter
  for torturing u for so long, only to realize just a few minutes have passed?
  <br /><br />
  on the other hand, when u r having fun with that special friend,
  or c a great movie, it seems like hours turn to minutes, and
  "where did the time ago???"
  <br /><br />
  That happens all the time, and the ability to control time
  at the time u wish is a good recipe to turn bad time to good time,
  and turn good time to something so wonderful u might have not experienced yet.
  <br /><br />
  Ready to get into some whacky states?

<div id="step-1" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Step 1: Pick Category</h3>
  pick a recurring situation u have trouble dealing with i.e. <br />
  going to the bank, dealing with a certain person, etc
  <br /><br />
  <input placeholder="I have trouble dealing with ..." />
  <br /><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(2)">I picked a category</a><br />
  - <a onclick="dontUnderstandStep()">I don't understand</a><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(0)">Back</a>
</div>

<div id="step-2" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Step 2: pick A SPECIFIC example</h3>
  or a future scenario of that recurring situation
  (i.e. a specific scenario of u standing in line for the bank, or talking to the teller)
  <br /><br />
  <input placeholder="My scenario is when I ..." />
  <br /><br />

<div id="step-3" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Step 3: Normal time</h3>
  run that scenario in your mind in normal time, just as u usually think about it
  <br /><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(4)">I ran the scenario in normal time, what's next?</a><br />

<div id="step-4" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Step 4: Describe (normal time)</h3>
  how was it to run the scenario "normally"?<br />
  how it feels like?<br />
  and how intense is the feeling?<br />

<div id="step-5" style="display: none;">
  <h3>Step 5: Fast time</h3>
  go back to the beginning of the scenario,<br />
  freeze the frame,<br />
  step inside the beginning of the scenario,<br />
  and hear and feel turning down a knob and slow YOURSELF to half speed,<br />
  so everything will be running twice as fast in your subjective experience,<br />
  and go through the scenario in fast time<br />
  i.e. every one in the bank will talk and move twice as fast as u<br />

  <h3>Step 7: Slow time</h3>
  go back to the beginning of the scenario,<br />
  freeze the frame,<br />
  step inside the beginning of the scenario,<br />
  hear and feel turning up a knob and speed YOURSELF back to normal speed,<br />
  then turn the knob further up and speed YOURSELF to double speed,<br />
  so everything will be running twice as slow in your subjective experience,<br />
  and go through the scenario in slow time<br />

  <h3>Step 9: Normal time again</h3>
  now try and run the same scenario in normal time,<br />
  and get the old feeling back, and notice what happens.<br />
  <br /><br />
  <textarea placeholder="I tried running the scenario in normal time like the beginning and noticed that ..."></textarea>
  <br /><br />
  for me it changed from negative to "c'mon out with it! let's get it over with!" sort of a comical impatience

  <h3>Step 10: advanced stuff (pleasure junkies)</h3>
  (if u r an ectasy junky like <a href="/who-am-i-anyway/">me</a>, love this u will ...)<br />
  repeat the entire process for a recurring pleasurable situation.<br />
  (this is some trippy shit ...)<br />
  I went for juggling and sex,<br />
  and juggled between the two,<br />
  not necessarily in that order ;)<br />
  <br /><br />
  When u r ready, repeat the process, and replace "trouble" with "pleasurable" as you come along
  <br /><br />
