      <h1>Grief To Appreciation</h1>

      <div id="step-0">
        Hello friend.<br />
        <a href="/who-am-i-anyway/" target="_blank">Adam</a> here, nice to e-meet u.<br />
        <br />
        u have someone u used to have in your life,<br />
        that as u think of him or her,<br />
        u don't feel yet the warmth gratitude, appreciation, and good times u shared,<br />
        but still feel the old feelings of loss,<br />
        and before we turn this around u might wonder ...<br />
        <br />
        - <a onclick="goToStep(1)">How is this going to work?</a>
        <br />
        (btw, the text in this page is formatted in a special way to induce a special change, it's grammatically "incorrect" for a reason)
      </div>
      <div id="step-1" style="display: none;">
        I'm glad u asked,<br />
        so here's how it's going to work,<br />
        as I've been studying human behavior, organisms,<br />
        how society shapes behavior, communication,<br />
        and the greatest learning machine of all, the human brain,<br />
        I'm going to give u some things to try,<br />
        and whatever works for u u get to keep,<br />
        whatever doesn't u file away in the<br />
        "thing's I've tried and haven't worked for me yet."<br />
        <br />
        Sounds good?<br />

        I want u to quickly share with me the following:<br />

        Good,<br />
        now,<br />
        in your <span class="your-age"></span> years on this odd planet, u have met many people,<br />
        and some of them shared good memories with you,<br />
        and were meaningful to you,<br />
        now,<br />
        as u think about some of them,<br />
        think of a person that is no longer in your life,<br />
        maybe he/she is dead, maybe not,<br />
        but that person is no longer in your life,<br />
        but when u remember him or her,<br />
        u have a good feeling,<br />
        appreciate the time u had together,<br />
        maybe it's a friend u used to have which makes u laugh,<br />
        maybe it's a meaningful teacher,<br />
        or a loved family member,<br />
        now,<br />
        as u think of that person, share the following:<br />
        <br />
        <form id="good-memory-person-form" name="good-memory-person-form">
          <div class="input-container">

        good,<br />
        now,<br />
        as u think of <span class="good-memory-person-name-ref"></span> now, and c all the good times u shared together,<br />
        feel the gratitude and appreciation for having <span class="good-memory-person-himher-ref"></span> in your life,<br />
        and all u learned and carry with u now and forever,<br />
        notice u can not only notice where in your body u<br />
        feel the good feeling first,<br />
        as u can also notice where in your body u<br />
        feel the good feeling flowing and spreading next,<br />
        and u can begin to notice where in your body u feel the good feeling where u feel good absolutely the best,<br />
        and as u do so,<br />
        and u are looking at <span class="good-memory-person-himher-ref"></span>,<br />
        notice what is <span class="good-memory-person-heshe-ref"></span> doing?<br />
        where do u c <span class="good-memory-person-himher-ref"></span>?<br />
        is <span class="good-memory-person-heshe-ref"></span> looking at you?<br />
        is <span class="good-memory-person-heshe-ref"></span> smiling at you?<br />
        do u hear <span class="good-memory-person-himher-ref"></span> talking to you?<br />
        and as u do so, u might notice if<br />
        the good feeling is cool or u prefer to feel it warmer,<br />
        and the more u feel that good feeling now,<br />
        the more it can fill you,<br />
        as u begin to realize u can learn to learn new ways,<br />
        to feel good,<br />
        now,<br />
        and appreciation,<br />
        and describe this good feeling vivdly in as much detail as humanly possible,<br />
        (u r human, are you not?)<br />
        <br />
        <textarea placeholder="the more u share here the better u will feel"></textarea><br />
        - <a onclick="goToStep(5)">I like this good feeling, let's continue</a><br />

        Good,<br />
        now,<br />
        keep making the good feeling,<br />
        and as u do so,<br />
        in that same way u think of <span class="good-memory-person-name-ref"></span>,<br />
        I want u to think of <span class="loss-person-name-ref"></span>,<br />
        so u c <span class="loss-person-himher-ref"></span> in the same place, colors, and angle as <span class="good-memory-person-name-ref"></span>,<br />
        hear <span class="loss-person-name-ref"></span> in the same way and from the same direction as <span class="good-memory-person-name-ref"></span>,<br />
        the way that makes u feel the appreciation,<br />
        and keep making the good feeling,<br />
        and as u do so, notice u might notice the good feeling spreads even more,<br />
        and u might notice u can notice the good feeling intensifies,<br />
        and how good do u feel now as u c <span class="loss-person-name-ref"></span> in this way?<br />
        <br />
        - <a onclick="goToStep(6)">I love <span class="loss-person-name-ref"></span> and I love this feeling,</a><br />

        Good,<br />
        now,<br />
        isn't it interesting,<br />
        to learn,<br />
        u can learn to learn new ways,<br />
        to feel good,<br />
        now,<br />
        and then,<br />
        in such a short time,<br />
        with little to no effort,<br />
        by playing with pictures and sounds in your mind?<br />
        <br />
        did u expect to feel all those good feelings a few minutes ago?<br />
        <br />
        And I guess I can also not help but wonder,<br />
        if u can wander around good feelings,<br />
        as u wonder how much more wonderfull feelings u haven't experienced yet,<br />
        u will b surprised,<br />
        as u begin to realize u can feel good<br />
        in more ways than u have ever wondered before,<br />
        as u wander more and more around good feelings, and if u are not careful,<br />
        u might end up stuck in good feelings only,<br />
        for the rest of your life (and then some ...)<br />
