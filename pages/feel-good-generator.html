<div id="step-0">
Think of a feeling or a resource u'd like to<br />
have more available for u now (and then),<br />
and u'd like to experience it more as u progress through life.<br />
  <br />
  <form id="resource-type-form">
    <div class="input-container">
      <input id="resource-input" placeholder="I want to experience more ..." required /><br />
    </div>
    <button>Let's continue</button>
  </form>
</div>

<div id="step-1" style="display: none;">
  And how many times has the earth revolved around the sun since your inception on this planet?
  <br /><br />
  <form id="age-form">
    <div class="input-container">
      <input placeholder="I am XX years of age" id="age-input" type="number" min="0" max="99" required />
    </div>
    <button>Done. Let's continue</button>
    <button>Onwards with the show!</button>
  </form>
  <br />

</div>

<div id="step-2" style="display: none;">
  Now, in all your <span class="age-ref"></span> years on this planet,<br />
  u had many experiences and events, in which<br />
  u experienced <span class="resource-ref"></span> in a variety of ways and degrees,<br />
  in which some r stronger than others,<br />
<br />
  and as u think of some of them now,<br />
  there's a few in particular,<br />
  or one, that REALLY comes to mind,<br />
  so go back to that experience and describe it here:<br />
<br />
  <form id="resource-experience-form">
    <div class="input-container">
      <input id="resource-scenario-age-input" placeholder="In this memory I am XX years of age" type="number" min="0" max="99" required />
      <input id="resource-scenario-location-input" placeholder="In this memory I'm in / at ..." required />
      <textarea id="resource-scenario-details-input" placeholder="In this memory I am looking at ... Hearing the ... Feeling the touch of ..."></textarea>
    </div>
    <button>Done describing the good experience</button>
    <button>This is cool, let's continue!</button>
  </form>
  <br />
  - <a onclick="dontUnderstandStep()">I don't understand</a><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(1)">Back</a>
</div>

<div id="step-3" style="display: none;">
  Go through that <span class="resource-ref"></span> experience out loud again, so that as<br />
<br />
  <i>"I am <span class="resource-scenario-age-ref"/></span> y/o,
  in <span class="resource-scenario-location-ref"/></span>,
  <span class="resource-scenario-details-ref"></span>"</i>
<br /><br />
  and notice the special moments,<br />
<br />
  Like in the movies, as u think of a good movie which induces within u a response, the movie itself could b "great", but there r those tiny magical moments in which there's such a build up,<br />
  and so many feelings come together inside, that is almost indescribable.<br />
<br />
  Go through your experience of <span class="resource-ref"></span> again,<br />
  and notice in which moments u feel <span class="resource-ref"></span> the most,<br />
  and fill in more details about it,<br />
  so u add on to what u've done already:<br />
<br />
  <form id="resource-experience-second-form">
    <div class="input-container">
      <textarea id="resource-scenario-second-details-input" required></textarea>
    </div>
    <button>I've added more things, feel even better now!</button>
    <button>This is cool, let's continue</button>
  </form>
  <br />
  <br />
  - <a onclick="dontUnderstandStep()">I don't understand</a><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(2)">Back</a>
</div>

<div id="step-4" style="display: none;">
  And as u think about that memory that induces <span class="resource-ref"></span>,<br />
  and u think of that special moment,<br />
  I want u now to step inside that memory,<br />
  so u c what u saw at the time,<br />
  hear what u heard,<br />
  feel what u felt,<br />
  and make the image brighter,<br />
  bigger,<br />
  add depth,<br />
  make it sharper,<br />
  so as u feel it more,<br />
  begin to notice u can notice more of the sounds,<br />
  the smells,<br />
  and as u do so notice where it is in your body that u can feel,<br />
  and a growing sensation of more than <span class="resource-ref"></span>,<br />
  I wonder if u begin to wonder,<br />
  as you wander around how much more u can feel good as<br />
  you notice where in your body u feel this feeling first,<br />
  and where does a feeling go to as it starts to move and spread, now,<br />
  as u keep the feeling spinning faster and faster ...<br />
<br />
  Keep intensifying the good feeling and <span class="resource-ref"></span>, and as u read what u wrote again, notice how much more u can feel about that same exeprience of <span class="resource-ref"></span> now
<br />
<br />
  <i>"I am <span class="resource-scenario-age-ref"/></span> y/o,
  in <span class="resource-scenario-location-ref"/></span>,
  <span class="resource-scenario-second-details-ref"></span>"</i>
<br />
<br />
  And as u experience more and more,<br />
  and it becomes more a part of u,<br />
  I'm curious if u get curious about what color could that feeling have,<br />
  as u feel it in more ways,<br />
  and I wonder if u like the adventure to<br />
  think of what sound could this feeling make,<br />
  and what color does a good feeling have,<br />
  when it feels as good deep inside,<br />
  and you can hear with me new sensations,<br />
  and when u r ready to get even more advanced ...<br />
  <br />
  - This is great, <a class="share-this-page-fb">others should experience this too!</a><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(5)">I'm ready to feel the advanced level!</a><br />
  - <a href="/i-dont-charge-i-accept/">This is great, I want to give back!</a><br />
  - <a onclick="dontUnderstandStep()">I don't understand</a><br />
  - <a onclick="goToStep(3)">Back</a>
</div>

<div id="step-5" style="display: none;">
  think about a situation not too far from today,<br />
  maybe in a few hours or a few days (and daze),<br />
  in which u used to not have enough <span class="resource-ref"></span> in the past,<br />
  and notice now as you keep spinning this feeling,<br />
  you r learning u can begin to realize how fast u can<br />
  learn to respond in new ways to old limitations which used<br />
  to have bothered u before, yet u will be surprised as each<br />
  time u do this, u can feel the <span class="resource-ref"></span> fill u even more,<br />
  and isn't it odd to feel as good about something u did not<br />
  think about just a few moments ago?<br />
<br />
  And as u wander more and more around what it is u do not<br />
  know yet, as more than just air fills your lounges and u succumb<br />
  to good feelings, and it feels so right to be lost sometimes,
  and what's still left in u that u don't want anymore can get
  curious as u think about the most important question of them all,
  and "how much pleasure can I stand", even if u sit or lay down
  in an odd place, deeper than before, as u surface back, only at the
  rate and speed as u feel more and more <span class="resource-ref"></span> fill bigger parts of your life,
  now and then, the more u do this now ...
  <br />
