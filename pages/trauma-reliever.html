  <p>Think about a memory u have, which pops to your mind every now and then, and still makes u feel bad, or in a way u don't want to</p>

<div id="step-1" style="display: none;">
  c <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <span class="your-name"></span> in the memory<br />
  freeze it <br />
  push it further away <br />
  make it smaller <br />
  mute the sound <br />
  so u c <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <span class="your-name"></span> at the beginning of the memory <br />
  far far away <br />
  small <br />
  muted <br />
  And let me know when you're done. <br />

<div id="step-2" style="display: none;">
  now, as u c <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <span class="your-name"></span> in the small still picture far far away, <br />
  fast forward it and freeze it at the end of the memory <br />
  you know the sound of a fast forwarding a cartoon? <br />
  like a cartoon, hear everything going forward very fast <br />
  Watch <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <span class="your-name"></span> far far away in the small picture <br />
  and let me know when u r at the end, seeing <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <span class="your-name"></span> in the frozen small picture far far away

<div id="step-3" style="display: none;">
  now, as u c <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <span class="your-name"></span> in the small still picture far far away, <br />
  and u r ar the end of the memory, <br />
  I want u now to step inside that memory, <br />
  so u r <span class="your-age"></span> y/o <br />
  and u r at the end of the memory <br />
  and I want u <br />
  to rewind that memory  <br />
  as fast as u can <br />
  all the way to the beginning <br />
  so u hear everyone talking backwards (yes u guessed it, like a cartoon) <br />
  c everything moving backwards in reverse <br />
  as fast as u can <br />
  and as u do so <br />
  I want u to add a circus music in your mind <br />
  let me know when u r done, and u r at the beginning of the memory <br /><br />

<div id="step-4" style="display: none;">
  now, did u ever think about what's bigger or a tree in different colors? <br />
  Silly, I know, I just wanted to distract u from a moment before the next piece :) <br /><br />

  <div>- <a onClick="goToStep(5)">haha that was funny</a></div>

<div id="step-5" style="display: none;">
  Think about that same memory which u used to feel bad about in the past, before you learned this process, and try in vain to feel the same way about it as before. <br /><br />
  U might b surprised to find it's not as easy anymore ;)

  <div>- <a onClick="goToStep(4)">Back</a></div>
</div>

<div id="step-6" style="display: none;">
  And how good do u feel now, as u learn, that u can learn to feel better and better about what it is that used to affect in a way u no longer wish? <br />
  1-10, how good do u feel now? <br />
  And notice, it's interesting to notice you can not only notice where in your body u notice the good feeling first, now, where u can feel the good feeling flowing next, and when u can feel the good feeling where it feels absolutely the best. <br />
  And if this feeling had a color <br />
  And what color would it have? <br />

  <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
  Isn't it cool u can learn so fast? <a class="share-this-page-fb">know others</a> that can enjoy that as well? Or u want to to it again on another memory first?
  <br /><br />
  <div>- <a onClick="goToStep(0)">I want to do it again on the same memory!</a></div>
  <div>- <a onClick="goToStep(0)">I want to do it again on a different memory!</a></div>
